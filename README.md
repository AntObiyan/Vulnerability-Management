## Introduction

This project aims to enhance the security posture of IT environments by leveraging the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) to identify, assess, and manage vulnerabilities. By integrating GSA's robust scanning capabilities, this project facilitates proactive vulnerability detection & comprehensive reporting. The ultimate goal is to provide a streamlined and effective approach to vulnerability management, ensuring the protection of critical assets and maintaining compliance with security standards.
